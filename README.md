# IT Sales CRM MVP

This repository contains a minimal full-stack CRM MVP for a mid-sized IT equipment reseller. It includes:

- **Backend (FastAPI)**: Provides a basic API endpoint at `/` returning a welcome message.
- **Frontend (Next.js)**: A simple page served at `/` displaying a placeholder.
- **Docker Compose**: Defines services for API and web, ready for development.

This skeleton serves as a starting point for building a full-featured CRM. You can extend the API, add database integration, and implement UI components.
